Project Description
In this final project, students will design and develop an Interactive E-Commerce Website
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to demonstrate front-end web
development skills, including responsive design, user interaction, authentication, and API
integration.
Project Objectives
By completing this project, students will be able to:
• Structure a complete website using semantic HTML
• Style and design responsive layouts using CSS
• Implement JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content
• Integrate external APIs into a real website
• Implement user authentication, including Google Login
• Publish and manage a website using GitHub Pages
Project Structure (Required Pages & Features)

7. User Account System (Very Important)
   A. Normal Login & Registration
   • User registration form (email, password, etc.)
   • Login form
   • Store basic user data using localStorage

   Requirements:
   • Login using Google account
   • Display user name and/or email after login
   • Handle logout functionality
   • Website must work correctly when published on GitHub Pages
   Projects without Google Login will lose 15% automatically.
8. API Integration (MANDATORY – 10%)
